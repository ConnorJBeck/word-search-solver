# word-search-solver
Word search solver, written in Racket.

Runs in Dr. Racket, with the Advanced Student Language enabled. There are two sample pieces of code available at the end of the doucment to test the functionality. Simple, but not very flexible around adding new word searches. Maybe in the future I'll try to simplify the inputting of word searches somehow - maybe OCR with pictures?
